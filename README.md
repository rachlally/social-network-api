# Social Network API

Social Network API site

## Description

The purpose of this Social Network API was to create a space where users can share thoughts, react to friends, and create a friend list.  This type of application is popular in today's social network. This was a critical exercise in understanding how to building and structure an API.

Building this application provided a better understanding of how to use MongoDB for a full-stack application.  I learned how to create a MongoDB through the Mongoose package.  I learned how to set up the database by creating the model structure and seeding data.  Also, I learned the syntax for the API routes.

## Installation

To install, run `npm i` for packages.  Connect to local server `node server.js`. View in Insomnia.   

## Usage

To view the routes and models at work, visit: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UDbXsTeh45H4zmtPEJ72RTc34dNoap-0/view .
